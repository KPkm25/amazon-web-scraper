# Amazon web scraper

This project uses NodeJs for the back-end to fetch data from an external API about the best deals available on Amazon and displays it on the front end designed using React

## Installation

Download amazon-web-scraper with npm

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KPkm25/amazon-web-scraper.git
  cd amazon-web-scraper
```
    
## API Reference

Get your OxyLabs API key from ```https://oxylabs.io/``` to use the web scraper.




## Deployment

First install the required node modules using:
```
npm install
```

To run the backend, run 

```bash
  npm run start:back
```
To run the frontend, run 

```bash
  npm run start:front
```

Remember that the API might take some time to fetch the data so the front end will remain on the loading for a while.
